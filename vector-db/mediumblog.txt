What are Embeddings?
An embedding is a technique for representing complex data, such as images, text, or audio, as numerical vectors.

These embeddings capture the essence of the data and show clearly the semantic similarity (or relationship) between different objects, with similar objects having vectors that are close to each other in the vector space. Thus, ML algorithms allow them to be efficiently processed and analyzed.

ML models often generate embeddings as part of their training process. For LLMs, an embedding model is put in place to create the embeddings

Embeddings are vectors that represent the essential features of a data point. For example, a natural language processing model might generate embeddings for words or sentences.

Embeddings can be used for a variety of tasks, such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection. Vector databases can be used to store and query embeddings efficiently, which makes them ideal for ML applications.

To see what embeddings look like, check out this Vectorizer created by Kenny, it converts texts to embeddings.

Note: An embedding is a vector representation, but not all vectors are embeddings.

Putting it all together, let us define a vector database.

What is a Vector Database?
A vector database is a type of database that stores and manages unstructured data, such as text, images, or audio, in high-dimensional vectors, to make it easy to find and retrieve similar objects quickly at scale in production.

They work by using algorithms like vector similarity search to index and query vector embeddings,

The importance of vector databases in LLM projects lies in their ability to provide easy search, high performance, scalability, and data retrieval by comparing values and finding similarities between them

Vector databaseâ€™s search capabilities can be used in various applications ranging from classical ML use cases, such as recommender systems, to providing long-term memory to large language models in modern applications, to text understanding, video summarization, drug discovery, stock market analysis, and much more.

As data continues to grow in complexity and volume, the scalability, speed, and accuracy offered by vector databases position them as a critical tool for extracting meaningful insights and unlocking new opportunities across various domains.

What are the benefits of Vector Databases?
Here are some specific reasons why vector databases are so well-suited for LLMs and generative AI:

Handling Massive Data Loads
Vector databases can handle the massive amounts of data that are generated by LLMs and generative AI. Traditional databases might struggle with the millions or even billions of data points produced in a single run, but vector databases are purpose-built to handle such large datasets with efficiency.

Efficient Similarity Searches
Vector databases can find data that is similar to a given query vector. This is essential for tasks such as image search and content recommendation, which are often used in conjunction with LLMs and generative AI. For example, if you are using an LLM to generate a new image, you can use a vector database to find other images that are similar to the generated image.
